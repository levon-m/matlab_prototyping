# MATLAB Bass Guitar Octaver Effect - Signal Processing Analysis

## Overview
This document provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time octaver effect implemented in MATLAB, specifically designed for bass guitar processing. The effect combines a polarity-flip divider with a sweepable low-pass filter to create a classic octave-down effect commonly used in bass guitar effects chains.

## Signal Processing Architecture

### 1. Core Algorithm: Polarity-Flip Divider

The heart of the octaver effect is the **polarity-flip divider** algorithm, which creates a frequency-doubling effect by inverting the polarity of the signal at specific intervals.

#### How It Works:
```matlab
% Zero-crossing detection and polarity flipping
for n = 1:block
    s = dry(n);
    if prevSample <= 0 && s > 0          % upward zero crossing?
        flipState = -flipState;          % flip polarity
    end
    wet(n) = flipState * s;              % apply current polarity
    prevSample = s;
end
```

**Mathematical Principle:**
- The algorithm detects **upward zero crossings** (when signal transitions from negative/zero to positive)
- At each zero crossing, the polarity state flips between +1 and -1
- The output is the original signal multiplied by the current polarity state
- This creates a **frequency-doubling effect** because the signal is effectively "folded" at zero crossings

**Why This Works for Bass Guitar:**
- Bass guitar signals have strong fundamental frequencies and clear zero crossings
- The polarity flip creates harmonic content that's one octave below the original
- The effect is particularly effective on low-frequency content (below ~200 Hz)

### 2. Low-Pass Filtering

The octaver effect includes a **first-order IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) low-pass filter** to shape the harmonic content:

```matlab
% First-order IIR LPF implementation
alpha = exp(-2*pi*fcCurrent/Fs);     % filter coefficient
for n = 1:block
    lpfState = alpha * lpfState + (1-alpha) * wet(n);
    wet(n) = lpfState;
end
```

**Filter Characteristics:**
- **Transfer Function:** H(z) = (1-α) / (1 - αz⁻¹)
- **Cutoff Frequency:** fc = -ln(α) * Fs / (2π)
- **Roll-off:** -6 dB/octave (first-order)
- **Phase Response:** Non-linear (causes phase distortion)

**Purpose in Octaver Effect:**
- Removes high-frequency artifacts from the polarity flipping
- Shapes the harmonic content to sound more musical
- Allows user control over the "brightness" of the effect

### 3. Wet/Dry Mixing

The effect provides real-time control over the blend between processed and unprocessed signals:

```matlab
mix = wetS.Value;
out = (1-mix)*dry + mix*wet;
```

**Benefits:**
- Allows gradual introduction of the effect
- Preserves original signal characteristics
- Enables parallel processing techniques

### 4. Peak Normalization

A simple peak normalization prevents clipping:

```matlab
out = out ./ max(1,max(abs(out)));        % avoid clipping
```

## Real-Time Implementation Details

### Buffer Processing
- **Buffer Size:** 512 samples (10.67 ms at 48 kHz)
- **Latency:** Minimal (single buffer delay)
- **CPU Efficiency:** Sample-by-sample processing for divider, block processing for filter

### GUI Integration
- Real-time parameter control via sliders
- Immediate coefficient updates when parameters change
- Clean shutdown mechanism via window close event

## Testing and Tweaking Framework

### Current Testing Capabilities

The current implementation provides basic testing through:
- **Real-time waveform visualization** via `timescope`

classdef EffectChain < handle
    properties
        effects = {}
        parameters = {}
    end
    
    methods
        function addEffect(obj, effect, params)
            obj.effects{end+1} = effect;
            obj.parameters{end+1} = params;
        end
        
        function output = process(obj, input)
            output = input;
            for i = 1:length(obj.effects)
                output = obj.effects{i}(output, obj.parameters{i});
            end
        end
    end
end
```

### Suggested Additional Effects

envelope = envelopeFollower(inputSignal);
% Use envelope to modulate filter cutoff or wet/dry mix
```
